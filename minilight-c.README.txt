Description
-----------

MiniLight is a minimal global illumination renderer. See the main MiniLight
readme for a general description.




Installation
------------

### Requirements ###

* MacOS 10.5, or Windows 2000/XP, or GNU/Linux 2010ish, or later


### Guide ###

Simply copy the minilight-c [mac|lin|win.exe] executable file to wherever.

The program reads the model file given and creates and writes the image file
requested; nothing else is touched.

(Similarly for the supplementary tools: minilightmerge and minilighttone.)




Building
--------

There are three separate builds, one for each program: minilight,
minilightmerge, and minilighttone. Each is an ordinary simple build. There are
no special requirements or dependencies: everything needed is in the supplied
archive (assuming the normal build environment and tools are already prepared).

However, LLVM-Clang invocation might vary so the build script might need
adjusting.

For each build, move to the base directory -- c, merge-tool, or tone-tool --
then choose and run a build script according to platform:
* Mac:     make/build-mac.sh (for LLVM-GCC 4.2 or GCC 4)
* Linux:   make/build-linux.sh (for Clang 3.0 or GCC 4)
* Windows: make\build-windows.bat (for MS VC++ 2008 or 2005)

Appendix:
The code uses double-precision FP and is for 64-bit builds. Changing either the
FP use to single-precision or the build to 32-bit probably means it would be
best, for execution speed, to change the other too.
